**LOSER: An Android app**
==========

We've created an app for your Android phone that helps you out if you ever lose it.
In the unfortunate event that you misplace your phone or it is stolen, you can use another cell phone (such as a friend's 
phone) to send your lost phone a text message with certain types of commands. These commands include:
* *location*: You'll get a text message back with the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of your lost phone's current location
* *find*: You'll get a text message with the address of the location or landmark to which your lost phone is nearest.
* *alert*: Your lost phone will make sure its volume is all the way up before playing an annoying sound for 2.5 minutes
* *lock*: Your lost phone will go to sleep immediately (if it isn't asleep already), and a new lock code will be put on your phone. Don't worry, this code will be sent back to you in a text message to the phone you texted your lost phone from.

**Before running the app for the first time, you must:**
*  Restart your phone
*  Enable the app as a Device Administrator (by going into the Settings app on your phone > Security
 > Device Administrators and enabling Loser as a Device Administrator)


To activate the app with a text message command if you lose your phone, you have to preceed the command with a passcode 
in your text message. This passcode can be set simply by opening the app on your phone and entering it in the Passcode box. You can also enable or disable any of the commands in the app.

The format of the text message you would send your lost phone would be in the format: <passcode> <command>. For example, if I wanted to remotely lock my lost phone, I would send a text message "doghouse lock" from a friends phone to my own (lost) phone.

If you send a text with the passcode only, your lost phone will send you back a list of enabled commands that you can send it.
